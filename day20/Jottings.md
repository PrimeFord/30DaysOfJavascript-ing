Coding conventions helps:

#### Coding conventions includes

5. Naming and declaration rules for variables
6. Naming and declaration rules for functions
7. Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments
8. Programming practices and principles

in the 30days of JavaScript the regular javascript convenstion was followed with some of our preference:

1. camelCase for variables and functions.
2. Variable names start with a letter.
3. We use const for constants, arrays, objects and functions. In stead of double quote, we chose to use single quote or backtick. Single quote is becoming trendy.
4. We removed semicolons from our code but it is a matter of personal preference.
5. Space around arithmetic operators, assignment operators and after comma
6. Arrow function instead of function declaration
7. Explicit return instead of implicit return if the function is one liner
8. No trailing comma in the last value of an object
9. We prefer this +=, -=, \*= /=, \*\*= instead of the longer version
10. When we use console.log() it is good to print with a tag string to identify from where the console is coming
